# UnMango Simple Injector Extensions

[![Build status](https://unstoppablemango.visualstudio.com/UnMango/_apis/build/repos/git/badge?branchName=master&api-version=4.1-preview.1)](https://unstoppablemango.visualstudio.com/UnMango/_build/latest?definitionId=30)

This is a repository for extension methods I have written for the SimpleInjector DI container.

At the moment, it is primarily ports of Microsoft.Extensions.* methods for SimpleInjector.

The base project has a few helper methods I've written myself.

The tests are extremely limited because I'm super lazy.

I'll write them when I feel like it, but since most of these methods are ports of Microsoft methods, testing will be limited.
