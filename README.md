#UnMango Simple Injector Extensions

[![Build status](https://unstoppablemango.visualstudio.com/unmango/_apis/build/status/unmango.extensions.simpleinjector-ci?branch=master)](https://unstoppablemango.visualstudio.com/unmango/_build/latest?definitionId=30&branch=master)]

This is a repository for extension methods I have written for the SimpleInjector DI container.

At the moment, it is primarily ports of Microsoft.Extensions.* methods for SimpleInjector.

The base project has a few helper methods I've written myself.

The tests are extremely limited because I'm super lazy.

I'll write them when I feel like it, but since most of these methods are ports of Microsoft methods, testing will be limited.
